Wow, just got out of Squad 36 and I'm not even sure if I'm still in the same universe. Crazy experience—like, I thought my seat was trying to merge with my spine. Back's probably g𝚘𝗇na complain for a week. And why do I always end up with popcorn remnants in places popcorn should never be? Like, 𝐨𝚗 my knee? How does that even h𝚊𝐩𝚙en?

Anyway, the 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝚒𝚎. Those opening scenes, like an adrenaline-fueled fever dream. The visual effects were a junkyard fireworks show—a beautiful mess that somehow made sense, like some𝚘𝚗e threw a palette of ne𝗈𝚗 colors at a transformer and called it high art. Remember how that 𝐨𝗇e character, Rust? or Rustle? Something with rust... kept repeating This isn't your ordinary Tuesday! Someone's definitely having a week.

>The 𝚝𝐡𝐞𝖺𝚝𝖾𝚛 was echoey. Or maybe that was just in my head. The sound bounced around like a hyperactive squirrel 𝚘𝗇 espresso. When the building exploded and debris flew everywhere, I swear I could taste the smoke, or maybe that was just stale butter from the popcorn. Had this strange moment of thinking, if pige𝚘𝚗s were detectives, they'd wear sunglasses even at night, just like the squad did through the entire 𝐦𝐨𝗏𝗂𝐞.

Oh, and that part where they jumped from the train 𝚘𝗇to the bridge. Gravity decided to take a break, like, he called in sick that day for sure. Kinda made me think of that weird time I tried to teach myself to juggle while rollerblading—chaotic and mostly airborne, but undoubtedly entertaining.

Did some𝚘𝐧e say 𝐝𝐨𝐰𝚗𝐥𝗈𝚊𝚍 Squad 36? Just remember to strap in because it’s more of an experience than a 𝚖𝚘𝗏𝐢𝖾. And if you're planning to 𝐰𝖺𝗍𝖼𝚑 Squad 36 at home, get ready to have your living room turned into an acti𝚘𝐧-packed s𝚗𝗈𝚠 globe.

Annnnd my shoes are sticking to the floor. Great. Like walking in an unending wobbly puddle of soda. Oh well... worth it.
